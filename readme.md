# Model Visualization Platform
#### This repository houses the content for the eZED Model Visualization Web Application.

The HTML content is deployed via GitHub Pages under the "pages" branch.

### Model Upload Notes:
- Currently, the only supported format is an OBJ & MTL pair.
- Any other embedded data within the OBJ file, such as positional data, will also be shown in the visualization.
- Model scale is calculated via the length of the model's bounding box, and the camera height is set to the center of the same bounding box.
- Models can be uploaded via the Upload Assistant desktop application. This assistant can be downloaded from the main branch of this repository.

### Accessing Your Chosen Model:
The required model can be accessed via the QR code generated in the downloads folder or by altering the URL parameters.

##### URL: `https://tannin-h.github.io/Model-Viewer/?model=YOUR-CHOSEN-MODEL`

Replace the fully capitalized field with the text displayed in the part reference field.

#### NOTE: If this field is filled incorrectly (i.e., missing or does not match a model in the database), the application will continuously load.
